      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
        I graduated from Hillcrest High School in May of 2021. There I took web-design and Microsoft Office classes where I discovered a love of computers. While in high school, I taught myself how to program a linux-based server and created a media server. After serving a two year mission for my church, I resumed my learning in linux-based systems and started to take classes related to cybersecurity and cloud-based systems. I have learned more into developing my linux-based server as well as how to build computers. I have upgraded my server to handle more data and traffic.

        While in high school, I worked as a sushi chef at Snow Eagle Brewing and Grill in Idaho Falls. There I learned the basics of food prep and safety. I discovered a love for cooking while I worked there. As my financial situation changed, I went to work as an Easy Tech at Staples in Ammon, ID. There I learned how to interact with customers and help fix computers. I learned how to diagnose issues and find ways to repair them. In August of 2021, I left on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to the west Texas and eastern New Mexico areas. There I served in various capacities. I helped people with farm work, home repairs and cleaning, animal shelters, etc. I learned to love the people in that area. When I returned home, I went back to work at Staples in Ammon. As again financial situations changed and payroll cuts at Staples, I went to work at Homestead Assisted Living in Rexburg, ID. I learned the basics in healthcare, such as toileting people, helping people get ready for the day, and assisting with their medications.
