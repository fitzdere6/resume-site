        <p>I graduated from Hillcrest High School in May 2021, where I developed a passion for computers through web design and Microsoft Office classes. During high school, I self-taught programming for a Linux-based server and successfully created a media server. After completing a two-year service mission for my church, I enrolled at Brigham Young University-Idaho, where I began studying cybersecurity and cloud-based systems. This furthered my knowledge and skills in Linux-based systems and computer building. I have since enhanced my server's capabilities to handle increased data and traffic efficiently.</p>
