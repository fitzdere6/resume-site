<h1>Education</h1>
<p>I graduated from Hillcrest High School in May of 2021. There I took web-design and Microsoft Office classes where I discovered a love of computers. While in high school, I taught myself how to program a linux-based server and created a media server. After serving a two year service mission for my church, I resumed my learning in linux-based systems and started to take classes related to cybersecurity and cloud-based systems. I have learned more into developing my linux-based server as well as how to build computers. I have upgraded my server to handle more data and traffic.</p>
